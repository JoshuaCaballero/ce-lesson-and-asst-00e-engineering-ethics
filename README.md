_Your study and submission work here..._

1.2.1: The most generic definition of "ethics" I found would be the "philosophical study of... a set of a social rules, principals, norms that guide... the conduct of people in a society..." from the "African Ethics" entry of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Plilosophy. From what I understand, ethics define what actions are deemed correct and incorrect in a  given group of people. I found the "The Ethics of Manipulation," "The Ethics of Belief," and "Virtue Ethics" the most novel from what I skimmed in their respective introductions.
1.2.2: Aristotle places the reason for ethical behavior to moral virtue. According to his work, humans strive for a virtuous life, which is achieved in part through conscious actions guided by a certain moral principle.
